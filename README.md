# Trinotate_pipeline
This pipeline uses various programs to annotate a de novo assembled transcriptome. Scripts here are my own, but were entirely inspired from the official github page for [Trinotate] (https://trinotate.github.io/). This pipeline only shows how I used the programs and with what precise commands.

Always submit the jobs from the parent directory, using the scripts found in 01_scripts folder. The pipeline is self-explanatory: the user must simply follow the numbered scripts.
